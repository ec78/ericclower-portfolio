# AI-Accelerated Workflows

I actively integrate AI tools into my work to improve speed, clarity, and consistency across documentation, content development, and product support. These tools extend beyond experimentationâ€”theyâ€™ve helped streamline internal workflows, reduce manual editing, and bring new features and training content to users faster.

This page highlights several ways Iâ€™ve applied custom GPTs, prompt engineering, and other AI-driven strategies across multiple projects.

## Key AI Implementations

### Custom GPT for Documentation Drafting
Developed a custom GPT workflow that generates first-draft technical documentation directly from GAUSS source code. This has accelerated documentation turnaround and improved style consistency across functions.

### AI-Powered Blog and Content Strategy
Used AI tools to:
- Automatically suggest internal links based on keywords and topics  
- Generate outlines and drafts for tutorials and announcements  
- Align blog tone and voice across multiple authors

### Markdown & HTML Automation
Applied AI models to quickly:
- Convert drafts to clean Markdown and HTML
- Standardize formatting across documentation and training pages
- Reduce post-production time for content creation

### AI-Assisted Prompt Engineering for Code Generation
Used targeted prompting and iterative refinement to:
- Generate GAUSS code templates from user requests and product features  
- Convert economic modeling logic into usable examples  
- Support content creation in both blog and documentation contexts

## Looking Ahead

Several of these workflows have been adopted informally by teammates, and Iâ€™m in the process of standardizing them for internal sharing. I see AI as a strategic toolâ€”not a shortcutâ€”and Iâ€™m committed to using it in ways that improve quality, reduce bottlenecks, and make complex tools more approachable.
