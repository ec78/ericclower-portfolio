# Estimation & Analysis Tools in the GAUSS Platform

## Overview

As part of my ongoing role at Aptech, I’ve contributed a wide range of core tools to the GAUSS analytics platform. These tools enhance the platform’s capabilities for estimation, inference, data cleaning, and diagnostics — serving both academic and applied users in economics, finance, and data science.

## Estimation Methods

Core statistical estimators developed or enhanced:

- **[Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS)](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/fgls.html)** for efficient estimation under heteroskedasticity.
- **[Quantile Regression](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/quantilefit.html)** supporting multiple `τ` levels, IID and robust VCE, and bootstrapped errors.
- **[Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/gmmfit.html)** with flexible instrument setup and over-identification testing.
- **[Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/kerneldensity.html)** for flexible nonparametric distribution modeling.

## Inference & Standard Error Tools

Support tools for statistical testing and confidence interval construction:

- **[Wald Tests](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/waldtest.html)** with support for parameter restrictions and multi-equation systems.
- **[Robust, Clustered, and HAC Standard Errors](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/cc/estimation-methods.html#standard-error-methods)**, integrated with multiple estimation methods.

## Data Preparation & Exploration

Tools for cleaning, tabulating, and understanding your data before modeling:

- **Panel Data Tools**: Detection of duplicate IDs, missing panel gaps, and panel data sorting, panel data timespans, and more.
- **Categorical Data Utilities**: Counting, tabulation, and frequency plots.
- **Descriptive Diagnostics**: Automated reporting tools for data inspection and modeling inputs.

## Technical Focus

- Designed reusable modular code with optional arguments and control structures.
- Prioritized computational efficiency and batch usability for large datasets.
- Aligned tooling design with real-world use cases in academic research, consulting, and education.

## Additional Contributions

- Integrated help files and usage examples across all procedures.
- Provided support for edge cases (e.g., unbalanced panels, singular instruments).
- Supported external GAUSS developers in implementing custom extensions using this toolkit.
