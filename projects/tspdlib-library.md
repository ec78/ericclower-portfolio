# GAUSS `tspdlib` Library

[`tspdlib`](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/tspdlib/docs/tspdlib-landing.html) is an open-source library for advanced time series modeling in GAUSS. I led this project in collaboration with a power user, providing strategic support, technical oversight, and public-facing resources.

I guided the library's structure, authored its documentation, and promoted it through blog content and targeted outreach. It has become one of our most widely used libraries and is now a centerpiece of the userâ€™s annual international applied GAUSS workshop.

### Highlights:
- Strategic collaboration with expert user
- Full documentation and use-case examples
- Community-focused promotion and onboarding
- Supports user retention and open-source visibility
