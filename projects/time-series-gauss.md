# Time Series Modeling Tools in GAUSS

## Overview

As a lead developer and educator for the **Time Series Modeling Tools (TSMT) library** in [GAUSS](https://www.aptech.com/), I played a central role in both extending and refining GAUSS’s capabilities for time series econometrics. My contributions spanned **new model development**, **API design and optimization**, and **user-focused documentation and training**.

These tools serve researchers, analysts, and students applying sophisticated econometric techniques in fields such as macroeconomic forecasting, financial modeling, and structural policy evaluation.

## My Role

### Core Responsibilities

- **Built new functionality from the ground up** for advanced time series estimation models.
- **Refactored and modernized existing code** to improve usability, consistency, and performance.
- **Designed a streamlined API** using optional arguments and output structures for greater flexibility.
- **Wrote a comprehensive documentation suite** and authored over 30 educational blog posts and tutorials.
- **Collaborated on product planning**, helping define scope, prioritize features, and respond to customer needs.

## New Features Developed

- **State-Space Estimation for ARIMA and SARIMA Models**  
  Added Kalman-filter-based likelihood estimation for models with latent components and seasonal structure.

- **Structural VAR (SVAR) Models with Sign Restrictions**  
  Implemented identification via long-run restrictions, short-run restriction, and sign restrictions.

- **Nonlinear Time Series Tools**  
  Developed and tested procedures for:
  - Markov-Switching Autoregressive (MSAR) models
  - Threshold Autoregression (TAR)
  - Structural Break models

These features expanded GAUSS’s modeling suite to support a broader class of nonlinear and regime-switching dynamics.

## Improvements & Enhancements

- **API Simplification with Optional Arguments**  
  Enabled users to specify only what they need — reducing learning curve and boilerplate code.

- **Modular Output & Control Structures**  
  Unified input/output structure across all time series functions for easier integration into workflows.

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Rewrote estimation routines and diagnostic tools for greater computational efficiency, especially for large datasets or multi-equation systems.

## Documentation & Educational Content

- Created a **complete online documentation suite** for the TSMT library, with examples, inline usage tips, and links to source code.
- Authored **30+ blog tutorials** on time series modeling topics including:
  - Forecasting with ARIMA and VARIMA
  - Impulse response analysis
  - Unit root and cointegration testing
  - Markov-switching model interpretation
  - Structural decomposition in SVAR models

These resources help bridge the gap between theory and application, serving both new and experienced users.
