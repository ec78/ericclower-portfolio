# GAUSS GitHub Transition & Collaboration Hub

To expand access, improve collaboration, and modernize version control practices, I led the creation of the Aptech GitHub organizationâ€”our first major step beyond Subversion-based infrastructure.

Working cross-functionally with our support, development, and content teams, I helped define a GitHub strategy that now supports public, private, and collaborative projects. Today, it serves as a central hub for our online documentation, open-source libraries, client collaborations, and internal enablement tools.
