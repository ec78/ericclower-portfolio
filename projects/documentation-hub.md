# GAUSS Online Documentation Hub

I manage and maintain the GAUSS Online Documentation Hub, the primary resource for all technical references and how-to content.

As part of a major restructuring effort, I oversaw the migration of static PDF manuals to a searchable, online-first format. I increased the inclusion of practical examples for core functions, which led to a measurable reduction in support tickets and improved user satisfaction.

### Highlights
- Migrated entire system to an online, searchable format  
- Added usage-focused examples for key procedures  
- Reduced support load through better self-service  
- Maintained consistent style, clarity, and structure  
- Developed a custom GPT workflow to automate documentation drafts from source code, accelerating content creation and improving consistency
