# GAUSS Onboarding Video Series

This video series was developed to help new GAUSS users quickly gain confidence and proficiency with the software.

As project lead, I oversaw the production processâ€”from content design and scripting to managing a team of graphic designers and education support agents. I ensured consistent instructional style, technical accuracy, and alignment with onboarding goals across the series.
