# Eric Clower 
## Building Analytical Products, Modeling Data, and Advancing Technical Learning

Welcome! I'm a technical educator, product collaborator, and quantitative analyst with 20+ years of experience in applied econometrics and statistical software. I specialize in making complex modeling tools more accessible through thoughtful documentation, hands-on training, and strategic content development.

At Aptech Systems, I support the development and launch of GAUSS by leading all user enablement effortsâ€”from onboarding and tutorials to support infrastructure and knowledge systems. I work closely with engineers, advanced users, and customer-facing teams to ensure our tools are technically sound, easy to adopt, and well-supported.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that reflect my focus on bridging product design, user education, and analyticsâ€”whether thatâ€™s through open-source collaboration, onboarding media, or example-rich documentation.

## ðŸ“¦ Product Development Projects
- **[AI-Accelerated Workflows](projects/ai-accelerated-workflows.md)**  
  A collection of tools and techniques Iâ€™ve developed using AI to streamline documentation, content creation, and code generation across multiple projects.

- **[GAUSS `tspdlib` Library](projects/tspdlib-library.md)**  
  A case study in advanced client collaboration, open-source development, and targeted promotion.  

- **[Time Series Modeling Tools in GAUSS](projects/time-series-gauss.md)**  
  Led the development and refinement of GAUSSâ€™s time series modeling suite, including new state-space estimation for ARIMA/SARIMA, SVAR models with sign restrictions, and nonlinear tools like Markov-switching and threshold autoregression. Contributed both original model implementations and API improvements, and authored over 30 blog tutorials and a full suite of online documentation.

- **[GAUSS GitHub Collaboration Hub](projects/github-transition.md)**  
  Led the creation of Aptechâ€™s GitHub organization to support open-source libraries, online documentation, and private client collaborations, enabling modern workflows and expanding public access to GAUSS resources.
