# Eric Clower 
## Building Analytical Products, Modeling Data, and Advancing Technical Learning

Welcome! I'm a technical educator, product collaborator, and quantitative analyst with 20+ years of experience in applied econometrics and statistical software. I specialize in making complex modeling tools more accessible through thoughtful documentation, hands-on training, and strategic content development.

At Aptech Systems, I support the development and launch of GAUSS by leading all user enablement effortsâ€”from onboarding and tutorials to support infrastructure and knowledge systems. I work closely with engineers, advanced users, and customer-facing teams to ensure our tools are technically sound, easy to adopt, and well-supported.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that reflect my focus on bridging product design, user education, and analyticsâ€”whether thatâ€™s through open-source collaboration, onboarding media, or example-rich documentation.

## ðŸ“¦ Product Development Projects
- **[AI-Accelerated Workflows](projects/ai-accelerated-workflows.md)**  
  A collection of tools and techniques Iâ€™ve developed using AI to streamline documentation, content creation, and code generation across multiple projects.

- **[GAUSS `tspdlib` Library](projects/tspdlib-library.md)**  
  A case study in advanced client collaboration, open-source development, and targeted promotion.  

- **[Time Series Modeling Tools in GAUSS](projects/time-series-gauss.md)**  
  Led the development and refinement of GAUSSâ€™s time series modeling suite, including new state-space estimation for ARIMA/SARIMA, SVAR models with sign restrictions, and nonlinear tools like Markov-switching and threshold autoregression. Contributed both original model implementations and API improvements, and authored over 30 blog tutorials and a full suite of online documentation.

- **[Estimation & Data Tools in GAUSS](projects/estimation-tools-gauss.md)**
  Contributed core functionality to the GAUSS platform including quantile regression, GMM, FGLS, robust standard errors (clustered, HAC), panel data cleaning tools, kernel density estimation, and more. Designed for extensibility and integrated with documentation and user tutorials.

- **[GAUSS GitHub Collaboration Hub](projects/github-transition.md)**  
  Led the creation of Aptechâ€™s GitHub organization to support open-source libraries, online documentation, and private client collaborations, enabling modern workflows and expanding public access to GAUSS resources.

## ðŸŽ“ Technical Learning & Instructional Design
  
- **[GAUSS Video Onboarding Series](projects/onboarding-series.md)**  
  Collaborated in end-to-end development of instructional videos, including scripting, editing, and team management.

- **[Online Documentation Hub](https://docs.aptech.com/gauss/)**  
  Designed and managed a searchable, example-rich resource that reduced support load and improved user experience.

- **[GAUSS Data Analytics Blog](projects/analytics-blog.md)**  
  Authored educational content and tutorials that support users and market new features.


- **Live Office Hours & Technical Support**  
  Provide in-depth walkthroughs and real-time support for researchers and analysts.

## ðŸ“ˆ Applied Quantitative Analysis Projects

Real-world applications of econometric modeling and data analysis, including forecasting, index computation, and custom methodology evaluation for clients and researchers.

- **Trilemma Index Computation**
  Supported research by cleaning and integrating international financial and macroeconomic datasets. Computed multiple dimensions of the trilemma index using consistent time series techniques across countries and timeframes.

- **Inflation Forecasting with Commodity Price Aggregates**
  Provided data processing, cointegration testing, and VECM/VAR/LARS estimation for a cross-country inflation forecasting study. Evaluated the forecasting power of global commodity price aggregates for five commodity-rich economies.

- **Price Discovery Code Consultant**
  Contracted to enhance and adapt an existing estimation codebase to meet client needs. Delivered extended coefficient estimates, bootstrapped p-values, t-statistics, and publication-quality plots in line with recent academic literature.

- **Time Series Forecasting for Private Client**
  Conducted a full time series analysis workflow: data cleaning, stationarity testing, ACF/PACF diagnostics, ARIMA and VAR modeling, and forecast evaluation. Delivered code, results, and model interpretation.

- **Review of Inflation Forecasting Methodology**
  Evaluated an existing ARIMA-based forecasting process, performed stationarity and structural break analysis, and developed a modular, automated ARIMA evaluation pipeline for improved transparency and reproducibility.
