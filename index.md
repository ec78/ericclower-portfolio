# Eric Clower â€“ Data Education & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! Iâ€™m a quantitative economist and education leader with over 20 years of experience in applied econometrics, statistical software, and training development. I specialize in translating complex technical tools into clear, accessible learning resources that support researchers, analysts, and organizations.

This site highlights selected projects from my work at Aptech Systems, where I lead GAUSS training, support, and documentation efforts. My focus is on building educational tools that empower users, streamline onboarding, and improve product engagement.
