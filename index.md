# Eric Clower â€“ Data Education & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a technical educator, product collaborator, and quantitative analyst with 20+ years of experience in applied econometrics and statistical software. I specialize in making complex modeling tools more accessible through thoughtful documentation, hands-on training, and strategic content development.

At Aptech Systems, I support the development and launch of GAUSS by leading all user enablement effortsâ€”from onboarding and tutorials to support infrastructure and knowledge systems. I work closely with engineers, advanced users, and customer-facing teams to ensure our tools are technically sound, easy to adopt, and well-supported.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that reflect my focus on bridging product design, user education, and analyticsâ€”whether thatâ€™s through open-source collaboration, onboarding media, or example-rich documentation.
